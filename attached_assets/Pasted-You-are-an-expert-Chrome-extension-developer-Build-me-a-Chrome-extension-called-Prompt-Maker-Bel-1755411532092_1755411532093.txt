You are an expert Chrome extension developer. Build me a Chrome extension called “Prompt Maker.” Below are the full requirements. Follow them exactly.

🎯 Product Vision

“Prompt Maker” is a universal Chrome extension that helps users write better prompts for any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, MidJourney, etc.).

User types a raw idea.

Extension asks: “How should this be written?”

User chooses from Simple / Professional / Technical / Custom.

Extension rewrites prompt using pre-defined smart templates.

If the prompt is too short, extension automatically expands it into a detailed version.

User can copy the improved prompt and paste it into any AI tool.


👉 Goal: Become the go-to helper for writing clear, powerful prompts — even from just a few words.

⚡ Core Features

1. Prompt Input

Big text box where users type/paste their idea.



2. Style/Audience Choice

Options:

👶 Simple → short, plain language.

👔 Professional → polished, business-like.

👩‍💻 Technical → structured, detailed.

✏ Custom → user types their own style.




3. Smart Auto-Expander

If input is very short (e.g. “blog about AI”), extension auto-expands into a longer, usable prompt.

Example:

Input: “Blog about AI”

Expanded: “Write a blog post about artificial intelligence trends in 2025. Include real-world examples, explain benefits for businesses, and keep the tone simple for beginners.”




4. Output Page

Shows rewritten or expanded prompt.

Buttons:

Copy Prompt

(Optional future: Save Favorite Prompt).




5. Free vs Pro

Free = 5 prompts/day.

Pro = unlimited prompts.

Pricing: $15/month or $100/year.

Payments handled via Stripe.

🛠 Developer Notes

Build with Chrome Manifest V3.

No AI API integration — expansion/rewriting done with pre-defined templates + string rules.

Save daily usage in localStorage (reset at midnight).

UI must be clean, minimalist, fast.

Support light/dark mode.
